mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, four times the value in ECX, and 0x10.  The problem is that if the value of EBX + ECX*4 + 0x10 is outside the accessible memory range, it will cause a segmentation fault or general protection fault.
